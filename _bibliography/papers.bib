  title={Estimating Nursing Home Quality with Selection},
  author={Olenski, Andrew and Sacher, Szymon},
  journal={Available at SSRN},
  note={Conditionally Accepted at Review of Economics and Statistics},
  year={2023},
  abstract={
We use variational inference (VI), a technique from the machine learning literature, to estimate a mortality-based Bayesian model of nursing home quality accounting for selection. We demonstrate how one can use VI to quickly and flexibly estimate a highdimensional economic model with large datasets. Using our facility quality estimates, we examine the correlates of quality and find that public report cards have near-zero correlation. We then show that in contrast to prior literature, higher quality nursing homes fared better during the pandemic: a one standard deviation increase in quality corresponds to 2.5% fewer Covid-19 cases},

    Verse 1:
In a nursing home, where the old folks stay<br>
There's a quality that's hard to measure<br>
But Olenski and Sacher found a way<br>
To estimate it with a Bayesian treasure<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
Estimating nursing home quality,<br>
Accounting for selection,<br>
With a mortality-based model,<br>
It's a statistical sensation<br>
<br>
Verse 2:<br>
They examined the correlates of quality,<br>
And found that public report cards were poor<br>
But higher quality homes did well in the pandemic,<br>
With fewer Covid cases, oh what a score!<br>

Bridge:<br>
A 10% increase in Medicaid reimbursement,<br>
Raises quality, and improves survival,<br>
It's cost-effective, and a life-saver,<br>

  author={Sacher, Szymon and Battaglia, Laura and Hansen, Stephen},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.08112},
  year={2021},
  note={},
  published={false},
  abstract={Latent variable models are becoming increasingly popular in economics for high-dimensional categorical data such as text and surveys. Often the resulting low-dimensional representations are plugged into downstream econometric models that ignore the statistical structure of the upstream model, which presents serious challenges for valid inference. We show how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) implemented with parallelized automatic differentiation provides a computationally efficient, easy-to-code, and statistically robust solution for this problem. Via a series of applications, we show that modeling integrated structure can non-trivially affect inference and that HMC appears to markedly outperform current approaches to inference in integrated models.},

  title={Frontiers: The Persuasive Effect of Fox News: Noncompliance with Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic},
  author={Simonov, Andrey and Sacher, Szymon and Dube, Jean-Pierre and Biswas, Shirsho},
  journal={Marketing Science},
  abstract={To what extent do mass media outlets influence viewers' trust in scientific evidence and compliance with behavior recommended by scientific experts? Exploiting the U.S. lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we analyze a large longitudinal database that combines daily stay-at-home behavior from approximately 8 million mobile phones and local viewership of cable news networks. Early in the pandemic, several of Fox News' hosts downplayed the severity of the pandemic and the risks associated with the transmission of the virus. A combination of regression analysis and a natural experiment finds that a 10% increase in viewership of Fox News in a zip code causes a 0.76-percentage-point reduction in compliance with stay-at-home behavior. The results imply a media persuasion rate that is larger than typical advertising persuasion rates on consumer behavior. Similar analyses using viewership of MSNBC and CNN, which supported lockdown measures, were inconclusive but suggested a smaller, positive effect on compliance with social distancing regulations.},
