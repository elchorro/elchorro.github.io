### About me

I am a Postdoctoral	Scholar working in  [Golub Capital Social Impact Lab](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/labs-initiatives/sil) at Stanford GSB where I work on large scale experiments implemented in partnership with technology companies and non-profit organizations.

I obtained my PhD in Economics from [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/) in May 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Andrea Prat](https://econ.columbia.edu/econpeople/andrea-prat/).

Previously I studied at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/economics) and was a Visiting Researcher at [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/).      

My research interests include Industrial Organization, Public Economics, Bayesian Statistics and [Natural Language Processing](https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/tutorials/tbip.html).

My Erdos number is [6](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/paul-erdos/szymon-sacher) and my Carlsen number is [3](https://freopen.org/@/FlaxJax).
